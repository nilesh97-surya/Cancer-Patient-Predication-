# Cancer-Patient-Predication
Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning
cancer is a significant health challenge worldwide, affecting millions of women annually. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial in increasing the chances of successful treatment and survival. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether breast tumors are benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on medical data. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, this solution will assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer early, improving patient outcomes, and potentially saving lives.

**Project Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate and reliable machine learning model to predict breast tumor classificationâ€”whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The ultimate goal is to provide healthcare professionals with an effective tool that aids in early cancer detection, thereby facilitating timely medical interventions and improving the quality of patient care. By analyzing key tumor characteristics, this model serves as a critical decision-support tool for oncologists and healthcare providers.
